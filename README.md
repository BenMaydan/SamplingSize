These data show that as the N increases and the p increases, there is a higher chance of capturing the true proportion p. As N increases, there is a higher chance because we capture more accurate average p^'s than for smaller n's. For the p increasing, there is a higher chance of capturing the true proportion p because the numerator of sigma(p^) gets bigger and thus there is a larger interval in which the true p can be found for millions of samples of p^.
